# PhotoConverter
Sample project that rotates photos, resizes them, and reformats them into PNG files.

This project contains a folder called "originals". Start by adding photos into this folder. Then run the program. All photos will be rotated counter-clockwise by 90Â°, resizes them to 128 x 128, and saves the rotated and resized copies into the "updated" folder.
